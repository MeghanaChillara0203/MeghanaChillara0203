# Hi there, I'm Meghana Chillara 👋

I’m a researcher-engineer hybrid passionate about building AI systems that create real-world impact. Whether it's building sustainability bots, deploying computer vision models in healthcare, or architecting intelligent real estate tools — I love combining data, code, and creativity to solve hard problems.

Currently pursuing an **MS in Data Science** at **Northeastern University**, with 4+ years of prior experience across industry, academia, and startups. I've worked on AI-driven health solutions, edge-compute powered chatbots, multimodal data pipelines, and more.

## 💬 Personal Note
AI for me is not just code — it’s a medium of impact. My goal is to continue building systems that help humans do better, live safer, and learn faster. If you’re building at this intersection too, let’s connect!

"**Build for good. Deploy with care. Iterate with impact.**"
